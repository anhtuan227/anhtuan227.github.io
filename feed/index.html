Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? What!? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha!

<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. <span class="highlight highlight-orange">I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at,</span> ain&#8217;t it? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.<br />

<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly… As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine. You&#8217;re all clear, kid. Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home! I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>

<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<p><div class="clear"></div><div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;" class="divider divider-dotted"></div></p>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. <span class="highlight highlight-orange">I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at,</span> ain&#8217;t it? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.<br />

<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly… As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home! I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79" src="http://themes.tielabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/01/post-image-180x300.jpg" alt="post-image" width="180" height="300" srcset="https://anhtuan227.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-image-180x300.jpg 180w, https://anhtuan227.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-image.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly…</p>
<p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them. He is here. What?! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. He is here. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? What!? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. <span class="highlight highlight-orange">I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at,</span> ain&#8217;t it? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.<br />

<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly… As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine. You&#8217;re all clear, kid. Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home! I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all clear, kid. <span class="highlight highlight-green">Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home!</span> But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.</p>

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
